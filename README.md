# Results

## Target Variables(s)

## Variable(s) Considered to be Features

## Variables neither target or Features

## How many neurons, layers, and activation functions were selected and why?

## Target model performance achieved?

## Steps taken to try to increase model performance

# Summary
Overall, I would say that the sigmoid function is the best activation function, at least between tanh and sigmoid, to use for this model.
